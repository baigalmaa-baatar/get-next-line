In 1950s Japan, 
university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, 
Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively)
, move into an old house to be closer to the hospital where the girls' 
mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, 
dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari which can be seen when moving 
from bright to dark places.[note 1] When the girls become comfortable in their new house, 
the susuwatari leave to find another empty house. One day, Mei discovers two small spirits 
who lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which 
identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as "Totoro". Mei thinks Totoro 
is the Troll from her illustrated book Three Billy Goats Gruff, with her mispronouncing Troll.
